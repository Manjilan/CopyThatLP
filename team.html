      <h3>Co Founder, UX | UI Designer</h3>
      <p>I’m a UX Designer hailing from Brooklyn, New York, with a background in Marketing. My UX point of view is human-centered, hypothesis-driven and iterative. My approach to UX design is grounded in research to better understand the user. So much of being a Human-Centered Designer is about bringing people together to have conversations around common goals. My superpower is making meaningful connections with people and ideas.</p>
